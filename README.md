  <sub><b>(1) Memory construction:</b> RGBD streams are fused in real time into an object-level

</p>

FARM is a robot memory system: it builds, **in real time (5–10 Hz)**, a
compact, open-vocabulary, object-level memory of a scene from RGBD streams —
3D Gaussian geometry, VLM captions, multi-modal embeddings, and viewpoint
evidence per object — and then **finds things in it from natural language**,
grounding spatial constraints ("the ladder *left of* the crates") through
relational predicates over the memory.

This repository is the official implementation: the mapping pipeline
(offline datasets and live ROS 2 share the same algorithm code), the
interactive 3D viewer with language retrieval, and the retrieval stack used
in the paper. The library imports as `scene_graph`.

For the production COLMAP + 3DGS workflow (17-stage FARM, dense
`gaussian_index -> instance_id` lift, optional ShapeR and the unified
Factory/Knaack viewer), use **[docs/PRODUCTION_PIPELINE.md](docs/PRODUCTION_PIPELINE.md)**.

For layer semantics, measured Factory/Knaack quality, dense-lift completeness
and the metric MV-SAM3D handoff, read
**[docs/QUALITY_AND_RECONSTRUCTION.md](docs/QUALITY_AND_RECONSTRUCTION.md)**.

## Setup

Prerequisites: an NVIDIA GPU and driver compatible with the configured CUDA
images, Docker with the NVIDIA container runtime, `docker compose`, Git and
Python 3.11+. GPU inference runs inside pinned containers. The pinned host
control venv runs CPU preflight, selection, catalog/report generation, trusted
scene-state inspection, plan orchestration and model provisioning; it therefore
includes the exact Torch and scientific packages used by those host paths.

**Compute.** The full stack (mapping + LLM/embedding services + 3D viewer)
uses about 50 GB of GPU memory in total (~65 GB on our largest scenes) and
~26 GB of disk. Tested on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 machines, and on NVIDIA
Jetson Thor on-robot.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GoldenGait/FARM-Project.git && cd FARM-Project

python3.11 -m venv .venv-control
.venv-control/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements/control-plane.lock.txt

# Accept the gated DINOv3-S+/16 license first, then provide HF_TOKEN or a
# permission-restricted secrets JSON. All revisions/hashes come from one manifest.
FARM_MODEL_PYTHON="$PWD/.venv-control/bin/python" ./bootstrap_models.sh \
  --secrets-file /absolute/private/path/secrets.json

./run.sh build             # builds the local scene_graph:latest runtime
./run.sh shell /path/to/your/data    # container shell; the dir is mounted at /data
```

If you cloned without `--recursive`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
first — the Docker build installs `third_party/yoloe` editably and fails
without it. A non-gated DINOv3 fallback ships in-repo, but the production
`farm.scene.v1` manifest requires the pinned DINOv3-S+/16 artifact and all
other manifest models to verify.

The optional ShapeR path uses a separate
`requirements/bridge-control.lock.txt` launcher venv plus pinned Docker
runtimes and requires Python 3.11+. Its exact NumPy/SciPy/Torch pins
intentionally conflict with the host control-plane closure, so keep the two
venvs separate.
The exact commands are in the production runbook linked above.

GitHub's autogenerated source archives do not include submodule contents.
Use a recursive clone or the complete source archive attached to each release.

<details>
<summary><b>DINOv3 backbone policy</b></summary>

The upstream standalone mapper auto-prefers the gated **ViT-S+/16**
(`dinov3-vits16plus`) — the
backbone the paper used, which merges objects more tightly and more stably —
whenever a local copy exists, and otherwise falls back to the bundled
non-gated ViT-S/16 with a warning. The fallback fragments room-scale scenes
into ~2× more objects (large-scale scenes are insensitive); see
[`EVALUATION.md`](EVALUATION.md) for measured impact.

The production COLMAP + 3DGS pipeline does not silently fall back. Accept the
license at
[facebook/dinov3-vits16plus-pretrain-lvd1689m](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-vits16plus-pretrain-lvd1689m)
and run the manifest-driven `bootstrap_models.sh` command above. It uses the
immutable revision and target path recorded in the model manifest and verifies
the final SHA-256.

Both variants are `hidden_size=384`, but only the pinned S+/16 artifact
satisfies the production manifest.

## Quickstart: FARM-Scenes warehouse

Three things you can run immediately after setup, on the warehouse scene of
[FARM-Scenes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GoldenGait/FARM-Scenes) (a 4,000 m²
Leica warehouse captured by an ANYmal quadruped). Download the scene + its
prebuilt scene graph (host, ~350 MB):

```bash
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf download GoldenGait/FARM-Scenes --repo-type dataset --include "scenes/grandtour/2024-11-25_warehouse/*" --include "scene_graphs/grandtour/2024-11-25_warehouse.pt" --local-dir /path/to/farm_scenes
./run.sh shell /path/to/farm_scenes    # mounts it at /data inside the container
```

> `scene_state.pt` uses PyTorch pickle serialization. Only open scene graphs
> produced locally or downloaded from a source you trust.

### 1. Explore a prebuilt memory in 3D

Serve the shipped scene graph (1,276 objects, 1,132 captioned) in the browser
— object boxes, per-object voxel evidence, captions on click — over the
scene's accumulated point cloud:

```bash
python scripts/view_scene_state.py --pt /data/scene_graphs/grandtour/2024-11-25_warehouse.pt --cloud /data/scenes/grandtour/2024-11-25_warehouse/cloud.npz
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> (the compose file uses host networking; if SSHed,
tunnel with `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 <machine>`). The viewer opens on a
framed overview of the whole scene; the first load streams a few million
points, so give the browser ~30–60 s to finish.

### 2. Ask it to find things

In the same viewer, open the **Query** panel and click **Start vLLM retrieval
backend** (first model load takes a few minutes; needs roughly two GPUs at
default settings — or point `VLLM_BASE_URL` / `VLLM_EMBED_BASE_URL` at servers
running elsewhere). If a server shows ❌ exited, the panel links its log — one
common cause right after the dataset download is HuggingFace's API rate limit,
which clears after a few minutes. Then type a query:

> `the ladder near the shelves`

This runs the full relational pipeline — an LLM parses the query into spatial
predicates, candidates are retrieved by multi-modal embedding fusion, and
predicates are scored jointly against the 3D memory (the `joint_v1` engine:
truncation-free anchor grounding, vectorized predicate tensors, pose-projected
view relations) — then color-codes the result (gold target, blue anchors,
purple distractors, amber relation edges) and flies the camera to the top
match. **Reset view** restores the full scene. Set
`VISER_SPATIAL_METHOD=unified_soft_w50` to run the paper's locked protocol
instead; the evaluation harness always uses the locked protocol.

The same retrieval is scriptable (start servers with `./run.sh vllm` first):

```bash
python scripts/query_scene_graph.py --pt /data/scene_graphs/grandtour/2024-11-25_warehouse.pt --query "a yellow forklift"
```

### 3. Rebuild the memory from raw RGBD

Reconstruct the warehouse yourself from its 2,553 posed RGBD frames (three
HDR cameras, LiDAR-synthesized depth) and watch it build live (stop the
step-1 viewer first — both serve on port 8080):

```bash
python -m scene_graph.offline.run --source frames-json --frames-json-dir /data/scenes/grandtour/2024-11-25_warehouse --save-path /data/out/warehouse.pt --covisibility --viser --keep-viser-after-run
```

Drop `--viser` for full speed (the live view costs ~6× throughput; see below),
add `--caption` for VLM captions (start `./run.sh vllm` first), and reopen the
result later with `scripts/view_scene_state.py --pt /data/out/warehouse.pt`.

---

## Bring your own data

Anything you can express as `(rgb, metric depth, intrinsics, camera pose)` per
frame can be mapped. Built-in sources for `python -m scene_graph.offline.run`:

| Source | `--source` | Input |
|---|---|---|
| FARM-Scenes / frames.json | `frames-json` | `frames.json` index + per-frame JPEG + depth (`.npy` float32 m or uint16 PNG with `depth_encoding`) |
| ScanNet | `sens` | one `.sens` archive per scene, no pre-extraction |
| NPZ chunks | `npz` | `.npz` with `images/depths/camtoworlds/K` (Habitat-sim renders, custom captures) |
| rosbag2 / mcap | `rosbag` | recorded `RGBDFrame` messages from the online pipeline |
| Replica & PNG-depth datasets | `scripts/run_pipeline.py` | RGB + depth-PNG sequences, YAML-configured |

**[`DATA.md`](DATA.md)** has the format contracts, download pointers, a
synthetic-NPZ smoke test that needs no external data, and the LiDAR-bag →
`frames.json` converter (`scripts/lidar_bag_to_frames.py`) for RGB+LiDAR rigs
without depth images.

Example — ScanNet:

```bash
python -m scene_graph.offline.run --source sens --sens-path /data/scans/scene0000_00/scene0000_00.sens --stride 5 --save-path /data/out/scene0000_00.pt --covisibility
```

> **⚠️ `--viser` costs throughput.** The live view streams RGB and re-pushes
> the scene every frame, throttling mapping by roughly **6×** (~11 fps → ~2 fps
> on an RTX 5090, ScanNet stride 5). Use it to watch a scene build; omit it for
> real-time or benchmarking runs. Async captioning, by contrast, barely
> affects mapping throughput.

<details>

| `--sens-path` / `--npz-dir` / `--bag-path` / `--frames-json-dir` | Source location |
| `--stride N` / `--start N` / `--end N` | Frame subsampling (sens, npz, frames-json) |
| `--camera NAME` | Camera id to tag frames with (sens, npz) |
| `--frames-json-camera CAM` | (frames-json) restrict to these cameras (repeatable) |
| `--cameras CAM...` / `--every-nth N` | (rosbag) camera filter / downsampling |
| `--batch-size N` | Frames per mapping-update call (default 1, matches online) |
| `--save-path PATH` | Where to write `scene_state.pt` |
| `--caption` | Async VLM captions (requires `./run.sh vllm`) |
| `--viser` | Live 3D view on port 8080 (~6× slower — see note) |
| `--keep-viser-after-run` | Keep the viewer alive after the source is exhausted |
| `--covisibility` | Co-visibility graph updates (helps proximity retrieval) |
| `--regions` | Periodic region clustering/labeling (multi-room scenes) |
| `--image-saving` | Copy frames into the HDF5 image store (default: references only) |
| `--target-fps N` / `--drop-when-late` | Real-time pacing / frame-dropping simulation |
| `--debug-trace-path PATH` | Per-frame JSONL pipeline trace (see `scripts/inspect_pipeline_trace.py`) |
| `--extra-param KEY:=VALUE` | Any StreamingMapper ROS parameter (repeatable) |

</details>

## Query a scene graph from Python

Any `scene_state.pt` is queryable once an embedding server is reachable
(`./run.sh vllm`, or set `VLLM_EMBED_BASE_URL`):

```python
from scene_graph.llm_utils import EmbedInterface
from scene_graph.retrieval.scene_graph_retriever import SceneGraphRetriever

retriever = SceneGraphRetriever.from_scene_state("/data/out/warehouse.pt", embedder=EmbedInterface(verbose=False))
result = retriever.retrieve("a red toolbox on a workbench")
for cluster in result["clusters"]:
    print(cluster["cluster_score"], [c["object_id"] for c in cluster["candidate_objects"]])
```

For relational queries (spatial predicates, anchors, superlatives) use the
pipeline the paper evaluates — `parse_query` + `execute_spatial_query` from
`scene_graph.retrieval.spatial_reasoning` — which is exactly what the viser
Query panel and `scripts/query_scene_graph.py` run.

## Run online (ROS 2, live topics)

The same `StreamingMapper` runs as a ROS 2 node; only the frame ingress
differs. Inside the container:

```bash
./run.sh ros2 caption_enabled:=true     # vLLM servers + the full mapping launch
```

One `frame_pub` node per camera (topic wiring in
`src/scene_graph/camera_config.py`) feeds the single `streaming_mapper`;
`mapping_five_cam.launch.py` runs a 5-camera Spot rig this way, and both paths
are validated end-to-end on real robot logs. Sensors without a depth image
work too: for an Odin1 fisheye+LiDAR unit, `odin1_depth_pub` projects the
LiDAR cloud into the camera and republishes standard RGBD topics:

```bash
ros2 launch mapping mapping_odin1.launch.py caption_enabled:=true
```

To replay a recorded sensor bag through the online graph, see the rosbag
section of [`DATA.md`](DATA.md).

## `run.sh` commands & environment

| Command | Where | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `./run.sh build` | host | Build `scene_graph:latest` from `docker/Dockerfile` |
| `./run.sh shell [<dir>]` | host | Container shell; mounts `<dir>` (or `$DATASET_DIR`) at `/data` |
| `./run.sh vllm` | host or container | Start the three vLLM servers in tmux: Qwen3.5-9B (captioning + query parsing, :8000), Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (:8002), Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B (:8006) |
| `./run.sh ros2 [args...]` | container | vLLM + `ros2 launch` for online mapping |
| `./run.sh stop` | host or container | Stop the vLLM tmux session |

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SCENE_GRAPH_MODEL_DIR` | `./models` | Model checkpoints directory |
| `SCENE_GRAPH_MAPPING_DATA_DIR` | `~/.ros/scene_graph/mapping` | Default scene-state output directory |
| `GPU_VL8` / `GPU_EMB` / `GPU_VL_EMB` | `0` / `1` / `1` | GPU per vLLM server |
| `VLLM_BASE_URL` / `VLLM_EMBED_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/v1` / `:8002/v1` | Point retrieval at remote servers |

## How the pipeline works

Both entry points funnel into the same per-batch update:

1. **Stream** an `(rgb, depth, intrinsics, pose)` tuple per frame.
2. **Segment + embed** — YOLOE detects and masks objects (open-vocabulary);
   masked pixels unproject into a 3D Gaussian per detection; DINOv3 features
   for merging.
3. **Filter** — border / degenerate / duplicate (IoU) detections dropped.
4. **Neighbor lookup** — candidate matches by feature cosine similarity +
   Hellinger distance between Gaussians.
5. **Correspondence** — union-find resolves which detections are the same
   object across frames.
6. **Update + co-visibility** — matched detections fuse into the object's
   Gaussian and sparse voxel cloud; unmatched become new objects;
   co-visibility edges link objects seen together.
7. **Caption (async)** — best-view crops go to a VLM; captions and their
   text/image embeddings are written back without blocking mapping.
8. **Prune** — low-information objects (walls, floors, clutter) periodically
   deactivated.
9. **Snapshot** — the memory serializes to `scene_state.pt` for retrieval.

See `src/scene_graph/pipeline/steps.py` for the pure-function implementation
shared by the ROS node and the dataset orchestrator.

## Benchmarks

This repository ships the **complete evaluation harness** for the paper's
grounding benchmarks — dataset loaders, the locked retrieval protocol, and
the canonical scorers. **[`EVALUATION.md`](EVALUATION.md)** walks through
replicating each experiment end to end (reconstruct → predict → score →
expected numbers):

- **FARM-Scenes** — runs **out of the box**: the public dataset includes GT
  and prebuilt scene graphs, and one command per split
  (`scripts/eval_farm_scenes.py`) reproduces the paper's numbers.
- **ReferIt3D (ScanNet)** and **IRef-VLA (HM3D)** — fully scripted
  (`run_scene_graph_*` → `eval_*` → `eval_predictions.py`, including the
  paper's visible-mask IoU metric and the curated evaluation subsets in
  `benchmarks/curated_utterances/`); you supply the ToS-gated ScanNet/HM3D
  data.

`EVALUATION.md` also records the parity check against the internal research
code and the DINOv3 mapping-backbone caveat.

## Models & licenses

This repository's code is **AGPL-3.0-or-later** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) —
a consequence of building on Ultralytics/YOLOE, which is AGPL-3.0. Each
pretrained model is governed by **its own license**: YOLOE (AGPL-3.0),
MobileCLIP (Apple), DINOv3 (Meta's DINOv3 License, redistributed in-repo with
the agreement attached), SigLIP2 (Google). Details and sources in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) — review them before any
commercial use.
